IDE research
============

There are a lot of IDE's available on the web. The ones that caught my attention:

**Atom**

**Brackets**

**Elicpse**

**Net Beans**


I will choose **Brackets**

download link: (brackets.io)

_pros_:

1. it is open-source

2. very suitable for HTML, CSS AND JavaScript

3. HTML and CSS real time updates

_neg_:

1. no compiler functionality

2. only front-end, less suitable for server-linked languages

3. Brackes needs plugins and packages to be really complete


The no.1 reason I chose Brackets: it is very handy for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Since we will start learning these languages Brackets will be very apt for this.
